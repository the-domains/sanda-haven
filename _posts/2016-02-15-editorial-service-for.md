become accomplished authors!

A few of the books published by my clients:

You've worked hard all your life to reach the pinnacle of your career, maybe reaching retirement, maybe still facing turmoils in our fluid society. Yet for all your professional success and activity that small (or maybe loud!) voice inside you begs to write that book that has lived in your brain for years. You know the plot like a well-traveled road. You know your characters like family (better than some of your own family members, I'd wager!). Maybe you've fleshed it all out in chapters; maybe it languishes in a pile of notes. But the story ticks inside you like a time bomb, ready to explode.
